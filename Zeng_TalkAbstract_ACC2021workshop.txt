We present a first sample-based formulation of the recently considered population observers, or ensemble observers, which estimate the state distribution of dynamic populations from measurements of the output distribution. The sample-based considerations are deeply rooted in the basic probabilistic framework underlying the problem and bridge optimal mass transport problems defined on the level of distributions with actual randomized strategies operating on the level of individual points.
